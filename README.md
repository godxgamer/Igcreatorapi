## Prerequisites

- 


# Support python and php both

## Usage

num="enter your number here" # example "919988776655" (without + )


you can use any country number with proxy


## Q- Why to use api ?
we can create instagram accounts with app , but the problem is you cant create more accounts is same device 
instagram blocks your "deviceid" you "android-id" and your "ip" also
also if you use app cloners this consume more human effert also you cant use proxies in it somehow instagram detects and block your account


# 
to bypass all detections and proxies issue igcreator api have "AI based country switching " this will automatically set all the parameters according to locations
also api have no detections

# Note
1- sometimes api throws exceptions (its instagram server side issue ) -> restart and use again
2- sometimes yours number get flagged by instagram AI and you get "please wait ,try again later" -> change proxy ip or restart
